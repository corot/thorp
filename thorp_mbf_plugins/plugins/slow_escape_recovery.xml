    <description>
      Try to recover from local planner navigation failures by slowly moving away from closest obstacles by
      following a decreasing footprint cost gradient on local costmap. Should mostly act on local planner
      failures, as global planner ones are mainly due to blocked paths, where this behavior has little to do.
