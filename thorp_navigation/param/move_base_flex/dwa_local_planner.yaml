# Trajectory Scoring Parameters

  occdist_scale: 0.01           # 0.01   - weighting for how much the controller should avoid obstacles
  meter_scoring: true           # false  - whether weights must assume goal/path distance in meters or cells
  forward_point_distance: 0.325 # 0.325  - how far along to place an additional scoring point
  stop_time_buffer: 0.2         # 0.2    - amount of time a robot must stop in before colliding for a valid traj.
  scaling_speed: 0.25           # 0.25   - absolute velocity at which to start scaling the robot's footprint
  max_scaling_factor: 0.2       # 0.2    - how much to scale the robot's footprint when at speed.
