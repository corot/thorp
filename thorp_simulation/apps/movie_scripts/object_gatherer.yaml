# Movie script for object gatherer app
# We update camera location when starting the following states
#  - frame: camera reference frame (better only use map by now, as Gazebo camera is always on map frame)
#  - focus can be either a 3D point (provided as a list of three floats) or a userdata key containing a stamped pose (TODO more flexible)
#  - eye must be a 3D point relative to focus location
# WARN: we don't check the container SM, so better avoid duplicated state names!

PLAN_ROOM_EXPL:
  frame: map
  focus: [8, 5.5, 0]
  eye: [0, -0.1, 12]
TRAVERSE_POSES:
  frame: map
  focus: start_pose
#  focus: [6.8, 1.5, 0]
  eye: [0, -0.1, 8.5]
GOTO_APPROACH:
  frame: map
  focus: picking_pose
  eye: [0, -0.1, 3.5]
PICK_OBJECTS:
  frame: map
#  focus: [0.4, 0.0, 0.4]  ### picking_pose
  focus: picking_pose
  eye: [1.0, -0.75, 1.5]
