# Movie script for cat hunter app
# We update camera location when starting the following states
#  - frame: camera reference frame
#  - focus can be either a 3D point (provided as a list of three floats) or a userdata key containing a stamped pose (TODO more flexible)
#  - eye must be a 3D point relative to focus location

PLAN_ROOM_EXPL:
  frame: map
  focus: [8, 5.5, 0]
  eye: [0, -0.1, 18]
INSERT_START_POSE:
  frame: map
  focus: start_pose
  eye: [0, -0.1, 8.5]
# use INSERT_START_POSE cause it happens only when we start exploring a new room
# cannot use INSERT_START_POSE nor TRAVERSE_POSES cause ATTACK finish as soon as we fire and then we alternate back
# and forth between ATTACK and TRAVERSE_POSES
ATTACK:
##  frame: ir_cannon_link
  frame: kinect_rgb_frame
  focus: [1, 0, 0]
  eye: [-0.98, 0, 0]
